Objective
Be the first player to reach 5000 points by rolling scoring combinations.

Game Setup
Choose a player to go first. Play moves clockwise.
Each player rolls all 6 dice on their turn and tries to build up points.

Scoring Values
You score points with specific combinations:

Single Dice:
1 = 100 points
5 = 50 points

Three of a Kind:
Three 1s = 1,000 points
Three 2s = 200 points
Three 3s = 300 points
Three 4s = 400 points
Three 5s = 500 points
Three 6s = 600 points

Straight:
(1-2-3-4-5-6) = 1,500 points

How to Play a Turn
Roll all 6 dice. Set aside at least one scoring die (or combo).
You may choose to stop and bank your points or keep rolling the remaining dice to try for more.
If you roll and don't get any scoring dice, you "Bust" and lose all points from that turn.
If you use all 6 dice to score, you may roll all 6 again to keep adding points.
After banking points, your turn ends and those points are added to your total.

Winning the Game
First to 5000 points or more triggers the final round.
All other players get one last turn to beat that score.

Highest score at the end wins!
